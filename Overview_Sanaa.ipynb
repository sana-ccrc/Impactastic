    "# 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses an **IBM Granite foundation model**, one of IBM’s open-source models optimised for domain-specific applications such as time-series forecasting. The model is applied here to predict **temperature**, **precipitation**, and **major climate indices** up to 6 months in advance over the Amazon Basin.\n",

    "For details about the IBM Granite Timeseries model, see the official repository:  \n",

    "# 2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale **climate modes** are recurring patterns of ocean–atmosphere variability that influence weather over wide regions. In the **Amazon**, they strongly affect **precipitation** and **temperature** by altering moisture transport and atmospheric circulation.  \n",
    "Forecasting these modes helps predict **droughts, floods, and temperature extremes**, which is crucial for agriculture, hydropower, and ecosystem management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Climate Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation):**  \n",
    "  Alternating warm (**El Niño**) and cool (**La Niña**) phases in the equatorial Pacific.  \n",
    "  - *El Niño* tends to reduce Amazon rainfall and raise temperatures.  \n",
    "  - *La Niña* often enhances rainfall across much of the basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TNA (Tropical North Atlantic):**  \n",
    "  Warm Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic push the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) northward, often leading to **drier conditions** in the northern Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TSA (Tropical South Atlantic):**  \n",
    "  Warm SSTs in the tropical South Atlantic pull the ITCZ southward, favoring **wetter conditions** in the southern and eastern Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation):**  \n",
    "  A pressure difference between the Azores High and Icelandic Low that changes trade winds and influences Atlantic SSTs, indirectly affecting Amazon climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Forecast These?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocean temperatures evolve slowly, providing a source of **seasonal predictability**.  \n",
    "By forecasting these climate modes, we can improve **subseasaonal predictions of rainfall and temperature** in the Amazon, and provide **early warnings** for regional climate impacts.\n",
